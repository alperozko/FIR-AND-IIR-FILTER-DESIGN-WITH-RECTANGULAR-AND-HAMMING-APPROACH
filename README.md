# FIR-AND-IIR-FILTER-DESIGN-WITH-RECTANGULAR-AND-HAMMING-APPROACH
hamming ve rectangular yaklaşımlarıyla Matlabda FIR VE IIR filitre tasarımı
In this project, FIR filter design is made using various window approaches.
Filter pulse response and frequency response changes according to sample number (M) value and filter coefficients are shown graphically.
